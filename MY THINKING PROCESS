# Design Inspiration & Competitive Analysis

Before proposing the new design for PolicySearch, I studied leading insurance and broker websites to understand what works well in terms of clarity, navigation, and conversion.

The two primary references were:

- TATA AIG
- Massive Insurance

These websites helped identify practical UI/UX patterns that guide users effectively toward insurance purchase and lead generation.

## Inspiration 1 — TATA AIG

### What works well

1. **Vertical insurance icons placed at the starting eye position (left side)**
   - Matches natural reading flow (left → right)
   - Immediately shows available insurance types
   - Reduces decision time for users

2. **Minimal announcement/news bar above navigation**
   - Communicates important information without clutter
   - Adds trust and professionalism to the interface

3. **Category-based scroll behavior**
   - When selecting Motor insurance, the page context becomes Motor-focused
   - Creates strong contextual continuity
   - User feels they are in the right section

4. **Smart header behavior on scroll**
   - Navigation bar disappears after the first section
   - A prominent **Get Quote** button appears
   - Focus shifts from browsing to action

### Observed Issue

- Navigation interaction causes a visual freeze/heavy overlay effect
- This breaks the smooth experience and feels disruptive to users

### Learning Applied

Use smooth, lightweight, non-blocking navigation transitions in the new design.

## Inspiration 2 — Massive Insurance

### What works well

1. **Very clean and simple navigation bar**
   - Easy to understand
   - No cognitive overload
   - Straightforward options

2. **Clear and highlighted POSP section**
   - Important for broker-model websites
   - Strong call-to-action for agents/partners
   - Clearly separated from customer journey

3. **Card-based insurance presentation**
   - Easy to scan
   - Friendly and modern layout
   - Improves readability

### Learning Applied

Adopt a simple navigation structure and give strong visual importance to the POSP section.

## Final Design Direction for PolicySearch

The new PolicySearch homepage will be:

- One-page, extremely clean, and direct
- Focused on **Insurance selection → Quote → Lead capture**
- With strong visibility for **POSP / Partner section**
- Minimal distractions, maximum clarity
- Navigation that supports the user journey without interrupting it
